        <h1>Choosing the Best Cooking Oil for Your Health</h1>
        <p>Selecting the right cooking oil can make a difference in both taste and health benefits. Each oil offers unique nutritional values and culinary benefits, making some better suited for certain dishes and health needs than others.</p>
        
        <h2>Olive Oil: A Heart-Healthy Option</h2>
        <p>Rich in monounsaturated fats, olive oil is known for its heart-protective qualities. Extra virgin olive oil, in particular, is packed with antioxidants that help reduce inflammation. Its distinct, robust flavor complements salads, pasta, and roasted vegetables well.</p>

        <h2>Avocado Oil: Versatile and Nutrient-Rich</h2>
        <p>Avocado oil is a favorite for high-heat cooking due to its high smoke point. It’s also rich in monounsaturated fats and loaded with vitamins E and K, beneficial for heart and skin health. With a subtle flavor, avocado oil suits a wide range of cooking styles, from frying to baking.</p>

        <h2>Coconut Oil: Flavorful but High in Saturated Fats</h2>
        <p>Coconut oil, with its tropical flavor, contains unique medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) that are believed to provide quick energy. However, it’s high in saturated fats, so it’s best enjoyed in moderation.</p>

        <h2>Canola Oil: The All-Purpose Choice</h2>
        <p>Canola oil is a versatile, mild-flavored oil with a balanced profile of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. It’s ideal for frying, baking, and everyday cooking due to its adaptability and healthful fat content.</p>

        <p>In the end, the healthiest choice depends on your dietary needs and cooking style.
